# DSA

A collection of Data Structures & Algorithms implementations in multiple programming languages — C, C++, C#, Java, and Python.  
This repository serves as a personal reference / learning hub for common DS & Algo problems, as well as an educational resource for others.

## 📚 What’s Inside

- Implementations of core data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, …)  
- Algorithms for searching, sorting, traversals, graph algorithms, etc.  
- Solutions written in multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python) so you can compare and learn language-specific idioms.  
- Simple, clean implementations intended for learning, practice, and reference.
